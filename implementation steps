== Implementation

The implementation of the tool will be carried out in several stages, each focusing on different components of the system.

=== Stage 1: Web Scraper Development

1. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Install necessary libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium).
   - Set up a project structure for the web scraper.

2. **Develop Scraper**:
   - Write scripts to scrape user profile data from various sources (websites, blogs).
   - Ensure the scraper can handle different website structures and extract relevant data.
   - Implement error handling and rate limiting mechanisms.

3. **Store Data**:
   - Store the raw data collected in the `user_profile_data` table.

=== Stage 2: Social Media API Integration (Optional)

1. **API Access**:
   - Obtain API keys and set up access to social media APIs (e.g., Twitter, Facebook).

2. **Fetch Data**:
   - Write scripts to fetch user data using social media APIs.
   - Ensure the data is structured and stored in the `user_profile_data` table.

=== Stage 3: Interesting Info Extractor

1. **NLP and Regex Processing**:
   - Develop algorithms to process raw data and extract interesting information using NLP techniques and regex patterns.

2. **Store Extracted Info**:
   - Store the extracted information in the `interesting_info` table.

=== Stage 4: Wordlist Generator

1. **Generate Wordlist**:
   - Create a wordlist from the extracted interesting information.
   - Store the wordlist in the `wordlist` table.

=== Stage 5: Permutation Engine

1. **Permutate Words**:
   - Develop algorithms to generate permutations of words, including capitalization, numeric suffixes, and symbol suffixes.

2. **Combine and Mix Words**:
   - Implement logic to combine and mix words to create new permutations.
   - Store all permutations in the `permutations` table.

=== Stage 6: User Interface

1. **Develop UI**:
   - Create a user-friendly interface for reviewing and modifying the wordlist.
   - Implement features to add or remove words from the wordlist.

2. **Integrate UI with Database**:
   - Ensure the UI interacts with the `wordlist` and `permutations` tables effectively.

=== Stage 7: Testing and Optimization

1. **Test Components**:
   - Conduct thorough testing of each component to ensure functionality and performance.
   - Test the complete workflow from data collection to wordlist generation.

2. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Optimize algorithms for efficiency, especially the permutation engine to handle large wordlists.

=== Stage 8: Deployment

1. **Set Up Deployment Environment**:
   - Choose appropriate hosting and database solutions.
   - Deploy the tool and ensure all components are integrated properly.

2. **Monitor and Maintain**:
   - Set up monitoring for performance and errors.
   - Regularly update the tool to handle changes in website structures and API updates.
