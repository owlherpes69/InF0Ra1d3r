= SPEC-001: User Information Extraction and Wordlist Generation Tool
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The tool aims to gather interesting user information from a target user's profile on social media, websites, blogs, or other online presences. The extracted information will be used to generate a wordlist, which will be permutated and used for brute force attacks on the target user's assets.

== Requirements

*Must Have:*
- Extract user information from various online sources.
- Identify and collect interesting user information.
- Store the collected information in a wordlist.
- Allow users to review and modify the wordlist.
- Generate permutations of individual words (e.g., "Ford" -> "Ford1", "Ford12", "ford1", "Ford1!").
- Combine and mix words to create new words (e.g., "Ford" + "Ranger" -> "fonger").
- Permutate combinations of words.
- Handle a large number of words (e.g., 300+ words resulting in 10,000+ permutations).

*Should Have:*
- User-friendly interface for reviewing and modifying the wordlist.
- Efficient algorithms to handle large-scale permutations.

*Could Have:*
- Support for multiple languages.
- Integration with other wordlist tools like WordlistRaider.

*Won't Have:*
- Direct brute force attack capabilities (tool is for wordlist generation only).

== Method

The tool will consist of several components working together to achieve the desired functionality. Below is an outline of the architecture, database schema, and key algorithms.

=== Algorithms

==== Interesting Info Extraction Algorithm

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Use web scrapers to collect user profile data from various online sources.
   - Optionally, use social media APIs to gather additional user data.
   - Store raw data in `user_profile_data` table.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Process raw data to identify interesting information using NLP and regex patterns.
   - Store extracted information in `interesting_info` table.

==== Wordlist Generation Algorithm

1. **Initial Wordlist Creation:**
   - Extract unique values from `interesting_info` table.
   - Store words in `wordlist` table.

2. **Permutation Generation:**
   - For each word in the `wordlist` table, generate permutations including:
     - Capitalization variations
     - Numeric suffixes
     - Symbol suffixes
   - For each pair of words, generate combined and mixed permutations.
   - Store all permutations in `permutations` table.
