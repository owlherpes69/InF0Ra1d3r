= SPEC-001: User Information Extraction and Wordlist Generation Tool
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The tool aims to gather interesting user information from a target user's profile on social media, websites, blogs, or other online presences. The extracted information will be used to generate a wordlist, which will be permutated and used for brute force attacks on the target user's assets.

== Requirements

*Must Have:*
- Extract user information from various online sources.
- Identify and collect interesting user information.
- Store the collected information in a wordlist.
- Allow users to review and modify the wordlist.
- Generate permutations of individual words (e.g., "Ford" -> "Ford1", "Ford12", "ford1", "Ford1!").
- Combine and mix words to create new words (e.g., "Ford" + "Ranger" -> "fonger").
- Permutate combinations of words.
- Handle a large number of words (e.g., 300+ words resulting in 10,000+ permutations).

*Should Have:*
- User-friendly interface for reviewing and modifying the wordlist.
- Efficient algorithms to handle large-scale permutations.

*Could Have:*
- Support for multiple languages.
- Integration with other wordlist tools like WordlistRaider.

*Won't Have:*
- Direct brute force attack capabilities (tool is for wordlist generation only).
